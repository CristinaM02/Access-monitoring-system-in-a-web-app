# Access-monitoring-system-in-a-web-app

This application serves as the graduation project of my Master's program and showcases an access monitoring system within a web application. The system is designed to track and record user activities in real-time, providing valuable insights to administrators. It was built using PHP and vanilla JavaScript.

 ## Description

The main purpose of the application is to provide a simple and fast way for getting and centralizing information about users, as well as their behavior during a session. With the help of them, an administrator can know what the users may or may not be looking for and can provide specific content based on users’ characteristics. Can be viewed as a tool for measuring, collecting, analyzing and reporting web data with the purpose of understanding and optimizing its use.
<br>Two types of users are distinguished – regular users that can view content and administrators that have various types of information and charts available about all the users and the content. Based on that, the available options for their role will be visible. 
<br>To be able to use the application one has to log in. At the login, some pieces of information about the users, like their location or data about the device and the software used are saved. Among the information that an admin can see are: data about the current users that are logged in, failed logins, the pages viewed, the links clicked and the forms. They also have the possibility to manage the accounts and the pages, as well as their content.
